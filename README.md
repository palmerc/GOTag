### Make card sized tags

I use this tool to print out a page of asset tags for instruments that are roughly credit card sized from a CSV file. I cut the tags out and place them in a vinyl card holder so that it is easy to tell each instrument apart and the name of the person renting the instrument.

The vinyl luggage tags were purchased from [ClearBags.com](https://www.clearbags.com/2-3-4-x-4-1-8-clr-vinyl-luggage-tags.html)
